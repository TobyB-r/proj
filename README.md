# Computing Project

Python implementation of the double ratchet encryption algorithm, which is used by Signal and Whatsapp to provide encryption provides forward secrecy for instant messengers by continually renewing keys. This means an attacker who is able to compromise the keys at one point will have to intercept every message sent or they will miss a key exchange and lose access.
Implemented using the pip cryptography package for cryptographic primitives and Tcl for user interface.
Done for my A level final project
